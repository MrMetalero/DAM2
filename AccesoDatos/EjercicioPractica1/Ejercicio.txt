Evaluation Test

Task: Create a database in PostgreSQL that meets the following requirements:

We need to manage a library system that keeps track of books and members. Each book has a title, an author, a publication year, and a unique ISBN. Each member has a name, 
a contact number, and a membership date.
A book can be borrowed by a member, and we need to track the borrowing date and the return date. A member can borrow multiple books, 
but a book can only be borrowed by one member at a time.
The library can have books that are not currently borrowed, and members can exist without borrowing any books.
The library should not allow a member to borrow more than 5 books at a time.
The ISBN of each book must be unique.
Requirements:

Create a complete E-R diagram including all necessary constraints, including those that cannot be captured in the E-R model. (2 pts)
Create a physical design that accurately reflects the requirements. (7 pts)
Populate the tables with a few records, ensuring that the design enforces all constraints. (1 pt)
